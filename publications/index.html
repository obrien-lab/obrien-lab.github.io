However, the structural origin of the large energy barriers preventing interconversion between these folding pathways is unknown. Here, we combine simulations with limited proteolysis (LiP) and cross-linking (XL) mass spectrometry (MS) to study the protein phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). Simulations recapitulate its stretched-exponential folding kinetics and reveal that misfolded states involving changes of entanglement underlie this behavior: either formation of a nonnative, noncovalent lasso entanglement or failure to form a native entanglement. These misfolded states act as kinetic traps, requiring extensive unfolding to escape, which results in a distribution of free energy barriers and pathway partitioning. Using LiP-MS and XL-MS, we propose heterogeneous structural ensembles consistent with these data that represent the potential long-lived misfolded states PGK populates. This structural and energetic heterogeneity creates a hierarchy of refolding timescales, explaining stretched-exponential kinetics.

Here, we examine whether it is possible to design small molecule compounds that can bind to specific folding intermediates and thereby avoid these misfolded states in computer simulations under idealized conditions (perfect drug-binding specificity, zero promiscuity, and a smooth energy landscape). Studying two proteins, type III chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT-III) and D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase B (DDLB), that were previously suggested to form soluble misfolded states through a mechanism involving a failure-to-form of native entanglements, we explore two different drug design strategies using coarse-grained structure-based models. The first strategy, in which the native entanglement is stabilized by drug binding, failed to decrease misfolding because it formed an alternative entanglement at a nearby region. The second strategy, in which a small molecule was designed to bind to a non-native tertiary structure and thereby destabilize the native entanglement, succeeded in decreasing misfolding and increasing the native state population. This strategy worked because destabilizing the entanglement loop provided more time for the threading segment to position itself correctly to be wrapped by the loop to form the native entanglement. Further, we computationally identified several FDA-approved drugs with the potential to bind these intermediate states and rescue misfolding in these proteins. This study suggests it is possible for small molecule drugs to prevent protein misfolding of this type. Copyright: © 2024 Jiang et al.

Unknown is how frequently this structural motif appears across the proteomes of organisms. And the correlation of these motifs with various classes of protein function and biological processes have not been quantified. Here, using a combination of protein crystal structures, AlphaFold2 predictions, and Gene Ontology terms we show that in E. coli, S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens that 71%, 52% and 49% of globular proteins contain one-or-more non-covalent lasso entanglements in their native fold, and that some of these are highly complex with multiple threading events. Further, proteins containing these tertiary motifs are consistently enriched in certain functions and biological processes across these organisms and depleted in others, strongly indicating an influence of evolutionary selection pressures acting positively and negatively on the distribution of these motifs. Together, these results demonstrate that non-covalent lasso entanglements are widespread and indicate they may be extensively utilized for protein function and subcellular processes, thus impacting phenotype. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Lan2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Pulling Forces Differentially Affect Refolding Pathways Due to Entangled Misfolded States in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain</div> <div class="author"> Pham Dang Lan, Edward P.

Bell theory predicts that in the narrow force regime where refolding can occur, the folding time should increase exponentially with increased external force. In this work, using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we compared the refolding pathways of SARS-CoV-1 RBD and SARS-CoV-2 RBD (RBD refers to the receptor binding domain) starting from unfolded conformations with and without a force applied to the protein termini. For SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the number of trajectories that fold is significantly reduced with the application of a 5 pN force, indicating that, qualitatively consistent with Bell theory, refolding is slowed down when a pulling force is applied to the termini. In contrast, the refolding times of SARS-CoV-1 RBD do not change meaningfully when a force of 5 pN is applied. How this lack of a Bell response could arise at the molecular level is unknown. Analysis of the entanglement changes of the folded conformations revealed that in the case of SARS-CoV-1 RBD, an external force minimizes misfolding into kinetically trapped states, thereby promoting efficient folding and offsetting any potential slowdown due to the external force. These misfolded states contain non-native entanglements that do not exist in the native state of either SARS-CoV-1-RBD or SARS-CoV-2-RBD. These results indicate that non-Bell behavior can arise from this class of misfolding and, hence, may be a means of experimentally detecting these elusive, theoretically predicted states. © 2024 by the authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Lan2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Deciphering the free energy landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 wild type and Omicron variant interacting with human ACE2</div> <div class="author"> Pham Dang Lan, Daniel A.

Recently, atomic force microscopy has been applied to characterize the free energy landscape of the RBD-ACE2 complex, including estimation of the distance between the transition state and the bound state, xu. Here, using a coarse-grained model and replica-exchange umbrella sampling, we studied the free energy landscape of both the wild type and Omicron subvariants BA.1 and XBB.1.5 interacting with ACE2.

Here, we use coarse-grain simulations of protein synthesis, post-translational dynamics, and dimerization to understand how synonymous mutations can influence the dimerization of two E. coli homodimers, oligoribonuclease and ribonuclease T. We synthesize each protein from its wildtype, fastest- and slowest-translating synonymous mRNAs in silico and calculate the ensemble-averaged interaction energy between the resulting dimers. We find synonymous mutations alter oligoribonuclease’s dimer properties. Relative to wildtype, the dimer interaction energy becomes 4% and 10% stronger, respectively, when translated from its fastest- and slowest-translating mRNAs. Ribonuclease T dimerization, however, is insensitive to synonymous mutations. The structural and kinetic origin of these changes are misfolded states containing non-covalent lasso-entanglements, many of which structurally perturb the dimer interface, and whose probability of occurrence depends on translation speed. These entangled states are kinetic traps that persist for long time scales. Entanglements cause altered dimerization energies for oligoribonuclease, as there is a large association (odds ratio: 52) between the co-occurrence of non-native self-entanglements and weak-binding dimer conformations. Simulated at all-atom resolution, these entangled structures persist for long timescales, indicating the conclusions are independent of model resolution. Finally, we show that regions of the protein we predict to have changes in entanglement are also structurally perturbed during refolding, as detected by limited-proteolysis mass spectrometry. Thus, non-native changes in entanglement at dimer interfaces is a mechanism through which oligomer structure and stability can be altered. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Rao2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Incorporating mutational heterogeneity to identify genes that are enriched for synonymous mutations in cancer</div> <div class="author"> Yiyun Rao, Nabeel Ahmed, Justin Pritchard, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

The possibility that synonymous mutations might be enriched in cancer has been explored in several recent studies. However, none of these studies control for all three types of mutational heterogeneity (patient, histology, and gene) that are known to affect the accurate identification of non-synonymous cancer-associated genes. Our goal is to adopt the current standard for non-synonymous mutations in an investigation of synonymous mutations. Results: Here, we create an algorithm, MutSigCVsyn, an adaptation of MutSigCV, to identify cancer-associated genes that are enriched for synonymous mutations based on a non-coding background model that takes into account the mutational heterogeneity across these levels. Using MutSigCVsyn, we first analyzed 2572 cancer whole-genome samples from the Pan-cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) to identify non-synonymous cancer drivers as a quality control. Indicative of the algorithm accuracy we find that 58.6% of these candidate genes were also found in Cancer Census Gene (CGC) list, and 66.2% were found within the PCAWG cancer driver list. We then applied it to identify 30 putative cancer-associated genes that are enriched for synonymous mutations within the same samples. One of the promising gene candidates is the B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) gene. BCL-2 regulates apoptosis by antagonizing the action of proapoptotic BCL-2 family member proteins. The synonymous mutations in BCL2 are enriched in its anti-apoptotic domain and likely play a role in cancer cell proliferation. Conclusion: Our study introduces MutSigCVsyn, an algorithm that accounts for mutational heterogeneity at patient, histology, and gene levels, to identify cancer-associated genes that are enriched for synonymous mutations using whole genome sequencing data. We identified 30 putative candidate genes that will benefit from future experimental studies on the role of synonymous mutations in cancer biology. © 2023, The Author(s).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Vu20234761" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Is Posttranslational Folding More Efficient Than Refolding from a Denatured State: A Computational Study</div> <div class="author"> Quyen V.

The ribosome, the molecular machine responsible for protein synthesis, is known to interact with nascent proteins, adding further complexity to the protein folding landscape. Consequently, it is unclear whether the folding pathways of proteins are conserved on and off the ribosome. The main question remains: to what extent does the ribosome help proteins fold? To address this question, we used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to compare the mechanisms by which the proteins dihydrofolate reductase, type III chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and D-alanine−D-alanine ligase B fold during and after vectorial synthesis on the ribosome to folding from the full-length unfolded state in bulk solution. Our results reveal that the influence of the ribosome on protein folding mechanisms varies depending on the size and complexity of the protein. Specifically, for a small protein with a simple fold, the ribosome facilitates efficient folding by helping the nascent protein avoid misfolded conformations. However, for larger and more complex proteins, the ribosome does not promote folding and may contribute to the formation of intermediate misfolded states cotranslationally. These misfolded states persist posttranslationally and do not convert to the native state during the 6 μs runtime of our coarse-grain simulations. Overall, our study highlights the complex interplay between the ribosome and protein folding and provides insight into the mechanisms of protein folding on and off the ribosome. © 2023 The Authors.

The extent of this phenomenon and how it happens at the molecular level are unknown. Through a meta-analysis of the experimental literature we find that in all quantitative protein refolding studies there is always a subpopulation of soluble but misfolded protein that does not fold in the presence of one or more chaperones, and can take days or longer to do so. Thus, some misfolded subpopulations commonly bypass chaperones. Using multi-scale simulation models we observe that the misfolded structures that bypass various chaperones can do so because their structures are highly native like, leading to a situation where chaperones do not distinguish between the folded and near-native-misfolded states. More broadly, these results provide a mechanism by which long-time scale changes in protein structure and function can persist in cells because some misfolded states can bypass components of the proteostasis machinery. © 2023, The Author(s).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Jiang2023308" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">How synonymous mutations alter enzyme structure and function over long timescales</div> <div class="author"> Yang Jiang, Syam Sundar Neti, Ian Sitarik, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 6 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '6 more authors' ?

How this happens at the molecular level is unknown. Here, we use multiscale modelling of three Escherichia coli enzymes (type III chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, d-alanine–d-alanine ligase B and dihydrofolate reductase) to understand experimentally measured changes in specific activity due to synonymous mutations. The modelling involves coarse-grained simulations of protein synthesis and post-translational behaviour, all-atom simulations to test robustness and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations to characterize enzymatic function. We show that changes in codon translation rates induced by synonymous mutations cause shifts in co-translational and post-translational folding pathways that kinetically partition molecules into subpopulations that very slowly interconvert to the native, functional state. Structurally, these states resemble the native state, with localized misfolding near the active sites of the enzymes. These long-lived states exhibit reduced catalytic activity, as shown by their increased activation energies for the reactions they catalyse.

Herein we probe which newly translated proteins are thermo-sensitive, making them susceptible to misfolding and aggregation under heat stress using pulse-SILAC mass spectrometry. We find a distinct group of proteins that is highly sensitive to this perturbation when newly synthesized but not once matured. These proteins are abundant and highly structured. Notably, they display a tendency to form β sheet secondary structures, have more complex folding topology, and are enriched for chaperone-binding motifs, suggesting a higher demand for chaperone-assisted folding. These polypeptides are also more often components of stable protein complexes in comparison with other proteins. Combining these findings suggests the existence of a specific subset of proteins in the cell that is particularly vulnerable to misfolding and aggregation following synthesis before reaching the native state. © 2022 The Author(s)</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Leininger2022125" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Erratum: Ribosome Elongation Kinetics of Consecutively Charged Residues Are Coupled to Electrostatic Force (Biochemistry (2021) 60:43 (3223−3235) DOI:10.1021/acs.biochem.1c00507)</div> <div class="author"> Sarah E.

Understanding the structures and molecular mechanisms underlying the binding of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 can contribute to quickly achieving this goal. Recently, a cocktail of REGN10987 and REGN10933 antibodies was shown to be an excellent candidate for the treatment of Covid-19. Here, using all-atom steered molecular dynamics and coarse-grained umbrella sampling, we examine the interactions of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with REGN10987 and REGN10933 separately as well as together. Both computational methods show that REGN10933 binds to RBD more strongly than REGN10987. Importantly, the cocktail binds to RBD (simultaneous binding) more strongly than its components. The dissociation constants of REGN10987-RBD and REGN10933-RBD complexes calculated from the coarse-grained simulations are in good agreement with the experimental data. Thus, REGN10933 is probably a better candidate for treating Covid-19 than REGN10987, although the cocktail appears to neutralize the virus more efficiently than REGN10933 or REGN10987 alone. The association of REGN10987 with RBD is driven by van der Waals interactions, while electrostatic interactions dominate in the case of REGN10933 and the cocktail. We also studied the effectiveness of these antibodies on the two most dangerous variants Delta and Omicron. Consistent with recent experimental reports, our results confirmed that the Omicron variant reduces the neutralizing activity of REGN10933, REGN10987, and REGN10933+REGN10987 with the K417N, N440K, L484A, and Q498R mutations playing a decisive role, while the Delta variant slightly changes their activity. © 2022 The Authors.

This is an unexpected observation, as cellular quality control mechanisms should remove misfolded proteins. Three questions, then, are: how do long-lived, soluble, misfolded proteins bypass proteostasis? How widespread are such misfolded states? And how long do they persist? We address these questions using coarse-grain molecular dynamics simulations of the synthesis, termination, and post-translational dynamics of a representative set of cytosolic E. coli proteins. We predict that half of proteins exhibit misfolded subpopulations that bypass molecular chaperones, avoid aggregation, and will not be rapidly degraded, with some misfolded states persisting for months or longer. The surface properties of these misfolded states are native-like, suggesting they will remain soluble, while self-entanglements make them long-lived kinetic traps. In terms of function, we predict that one-third of proteins can misfold into soluble less-functional states. For the heavily entangled protein glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, limited-proteolysis mass spectrometry experiments interrogating misfolded conformations of the protein are consistent with the structural changes predicted by our simulations. These results therefore provide an explanation for how proteins can misfold into soluble conformations with reduced functionality that can bypass proteostasis, and indicate, unexpectedly, this may be a wide-spread phenomenon. © 2022, The Author(s).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Zhao2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A pan-CRISPR analysis of mammalian cell specificity identifies ultra-compact sgRNA subsets for genome-scale experiments</div> <div class="author"> Boyang Zhao, Yiyun Rao, Scott Leighow, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

This context specificity confounds genetic analysis and prevents reproducible genome engineering. Genome-wide CRISPR compendia across most common human cell lines offer the largest opportunity to understand the biology of cell specificity. The prevailing viewpoint, synthetic lethality, occurs when a genetic alteration creates a unique CRISPR dependency. Here, we use machine learning for an unbiased investigation of cell type specificity. Quantifying model accuracy, we find that most cell type specific phenotypes are predicted by the function of related genes of wild-type sequence, not synthetic lethal relationships. These models then identify unexpected sets of 100-300 genes where reduced CRISPR measurements can produce genome-scale loss-of-function predictions across &gt;18,000 genes. Thus, it is possible to reduce in vitro CRISPR libraries by orders of magnitude—with some information loss—when we remove redundant genes and not redundant sgRNAs. © 2022, The Author(s).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Persichetti20229748" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Modeling Ensembles of Enzyme Reaction Pathways with Hi-MSM Reveals the Importance of Accounting for Pathway Diversity</div> <div class="author"> Joseph R.

These assumptions reduce computational cost; however, their validity has not been extensively tested. This is due in part to the lack of a rigorous formalism for integrating disparate pathway information from dynamical QM/MM calculations. Here, we present a way to model ensembles of reaction pathways efficiently using a divide-and-conquer strategy through Hierarchical Markov State Modeling (Hi-MSM). This approach allows information on multiple, distinct pathways to be incorporated into a chemical kinetic model, and it allows us to test these two assumptions. Applying Hi-MSM to the reaction carried out by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) we find (i) there are multiple, distinct pathways significantly contributing to the overall flux of the reaction that the conventional approach does not identify and (ii) that the conventional approach does not identify the dominant reaction pathway. Thus, both assumptions underpinning the conventional approach are violated. Since DHFR is a relatively small enzyme, and configuration space scales exponentially with protein size, accounting for multiple reaction pathways is likely to be necessary for most enzymes. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Ribosome profiling is a method that enables the study of transcriptome-wide translation. A fundamental, technical challenge in analyzing Ribo-Seq data is identifying the A-site location on ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. Identification of the A-site is essential as it is at this location on the ribosome where a codon is translated into an amino acid. Incorrect assignment of a read to the A-site can lead to lower signal-to-noise ratio and loss of correlations necessary to understand the molecular factors influencing translation. Therefore, an easy-to-use and accurate analysis tool is needed to accurately identify the A-site locations. Results: We present RiboA, a web application that identifies the most accurate A-site location on a ribosome-protected mRNA fragment and generates the A-site read density profiles. It uses an Integer Programming method that reflects the biological fact that the A-site of actively translating ribosomes is generally located between the second codon and stop codon of a transcript, and utilizes a wide range of mRNA fragment sizes in and around the coding sequence (CDS). The web application is containerized with Docker, and it can be easily ported across platforms. Conclusions: The Integer Programming method that RiboA utilizes is the most accurate in identifying the A-site on Ribo-Seq mRNA fragments compared to other methods. RiboA makes it easier for the community to use this method via a user-friendly and portable web application. In addition, RiboA supports reproducible analyses by tracking all the input datasets and parameters, and it provides enhanced visualization to facilitate scientific exploration. RiboA is available as a web service at https://a-site.vmhost.psu.edu/.

The molecular origins of this class of allosteric coupling remain unknown. We demonstrate, using multiscale simulations, that positively charged residues generate large forces that move the P-site amino acid away from the A-site amino acid. Negatively charged residues generate forces of similar magnitude but move the A- and P-sites closer together. These conformational changes, respectively, increase and decrease the transition state barrier height to peptide bond formation, explaining how charged residues mechanochemically alter translation speed. This mechanochemical mechanism is consistent with in vivo ribosome profiling data exhibiting proportionality between translation speed and the number of charged residues, experimental data characterizing nascent chain conformations, and a previously published cryo-EM structure of a ribosome-nascent chain complex containing consecutive lysines. These results expand the role of mechanochemistry in translation and provide a framework for interpreting experimental results on translation speed. © </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Nguyen20217368" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Electrostatic Interactions Explain the Higher Binding Affinity of the CR3022 Antibody for SARS-CoV-2 than the 4A8 Antibody</div> <div class="author"> Hung Nguyen, Pham Dang Lan, Daniel A.

Here, we use steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and coarse-grained simulations to estimate the binding affinity of the monoclonal antibodies CR3022 and 4A8 to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and SARS-CoV-2 N-terminal domain (NTD). Consistent with experiments, our SMD and coarse-grained simulations both indicate that CR3022 has a higher affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD than 4A8 for the NTD, and the coarse-grained simulations indicate the former binds three times stronger to its respective epitope. This finding shows that CR3022 is a candidate for Covid-19 therapy and is likely a better choice than 4A8. Energetic decomposition of the interaction energies between these two complexes reveals that electrostatic interactions explain the difference in the observed binding affinity between the two complexes. This result could lead to a new approach for developing anti-Covid-19 antibodies in which good candidates must contain charged amino acids in the area of contact with the virus. © 2021 The Authors.

Mutual exclusivity has been an empirically useful signal for identifying activating mutations that respond to single agent targeted therapies. However, a low mutation frequency can underpower this signal for rare variants. We develop a resampling based method for the direct pairwise comparison of conditional selection between sets of gene pairs. We apply this method to a transcript variant of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in melanoma, termed ALKATI that was suggested to predict sensitivity to ALK inhibitors and we find that it is not mutually exclusive with key melanoma oncogenes. Furthermore, we find that ALKATI is not likely to be sufficient for cellular transformation or growth, and it does not predict single agent therapeutic dependency. Our work strongly disfavors the role of ALKATI as a targetable oncogenic driver that might be sensitive to single agent ALK treatment. © 2021</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Sharma2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Combinations of slow-translating codon clusters can increase mRNA half-life in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</div> <div class="author"> Ajeet K.

The impact of multiple nonoptimal codon clusters on a transcript’s half-life, however, is unknown. Using a kinetic model, we predict that inserting a second nonoptimal cluster near the 50 end can lead to synergistic effects that increase a messenger RNA’s (mRNA’s) half-life in S. cerevisiae. Specifically, the 50 end cluster suppresses the formation of ribosome queues, reducing the interaction of ribosome-associated quality control factors with stalled ribosomes. We experimentally validate this prediction by introducing two nonoptimal clusters into three different genes and find that their mRNA half-life increases up to fourfold. The model also predicts that in the presence of two clusters, the cluster closest to the 50 end is the primary determinant of mRNA half-life. These results suggest the “translational ramp,” in which nonoptimal codons are located near the start codon and increase translational efficiency, may have the additional biological benefit of allowing downstream slow-codon clusters to be present without decreasing mRNA half-life. These results indicate that codon usage bias plays a more nuanced role in controlling cellular protein levels than previously thought. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Most observations to date involve force vectors aligned collinear with the long axis of the ribosome exit tunnel. What is poorly understood is how force applied in other directions will impact the rate of peptide bond formation catalyzed by the ribosome. Here, we utilize quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics simulations to estimate the changes in the activation free energy as a consequence of applying a constant force in various directions on the C-terminal residue at the P-site. Qualitatively consistent with the Bell model, we find this force can either accelerate, decelerate, or not alter the reaction rate depending on the force direction. A force in the average direction between the P-site 3′ O-C ester bond that breaks and the peptide bond that forms accelerates the reaction. A force in the opposite direction slows down the reaction as it opposes these bonds breaking and forming, but surprisingly it does not do so to the maximum extent possible. In this case, there is a counterbalancing trend; the force in this direction brings the A-site amino nitrogen and the P-site tRNA A76 3′ oxygen groups closer together, which promotes one of the proton shuttling steps of the reaction. We find the maximum force-induced slowdown occurs 37° off this axis. If force is applied in orthogonal directions to the reaction coordinates, there is no significant change in the reaction speed. These results indicate that there is a richer set of scenarios of force effects on translation speed that have yet to be experimentally explored and raise the possibility that cells could use these mechanochemical effects to modulate and regulate protein synthesis. © 2021 American Chemical Society</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Vu202111851" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The driving force for co-translational protein folding is weaker in the ribosome vestibule due to greater water ordering</div> <div class="author"> Quyen V.

Here, we test if a contribution to this destabilization is a weakening of hydrophobic association, the driving force for protein folding. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we calculate the potential-of-mean force between two methane molecules along the center line of the ribosome exit tunnel and in bulk solution. Associated methanes, we find, are half as stable in the ribosome’s vestibule as compared to bulk solution, demonstrating that the hydrophobic effect is weakened by the presence of the ribosome. This decreased stability arises from a decrease in the amount of water entropy gained upon the association of the methanes. And this decreased entropy gain originates from water molecules being more ordered in the vestibule as compared to bulk solution. Therefore, the hydrophobic effect is weaker in the vestibule because waters released from the first solvation shell of methanes upon association do not gain as much entropy in the vestibule as they do upon release in bulk solution. These findings mean that nascent proteins pass through a ribosome vestibule environment that can destabilize folded structures, which has the potential to influence co-translational protein folding pathways, energetics, and kinetics. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ahmed2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Pairs of amino acids at the P- and A-sites of the ribosome predictably and causally modulate translation-elongation rates: Amino acid pairs module translation-elongation rates</div> <div class="author"> Nabeel Ahmed, Ulrike A.

Translation-elongation speed is influenced by molecular factors within mRNA and protein sequences. For example, the presence of proline in the ribosome’s P- or A-site slows down translation, but the effect of other pairs of amino acids, in the context of all 400 possible pairs, has not been characterized. Here, we study Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a combination of bioinformatics, mutational experiments, and evolutionary analyses, and show that many different pairs of amino acids and their associated tRNA molecules predictably and causally encode translation rate information when these pairs are present in the A- and P-sites of the ribosome independent of other factors known to influence translation speed including mRNA structure, wobble base pairing, tripeptide motifs, positively charged upstream nascent chain residues, and cognate tRNA concentration. The fast-translating pairs of amino acids that we identify are enriched four-fold relative to the slow-translating pairs across Saccharomyces cerevisiae’s proteome, while the slow-translating pairs are enriched downstream of domain boundaries. Thus, the chemical identity of amino acid pairs contributes to variability in translation rates, elongation kinetics are causally encoded in the primary structure of proteins, and signatures of evolutionary selection indicate their potential role in co-translational processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Leininger20206809" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Forcing the ribosome to change its message</div> <div class="author"> Sarah E.

Chain-of-states simulations allow sampling over large free-energy barriers but are often constructed using a single pathway that is unlikely to thermodynamically average over orthogonal degrees of freedom in complex systems. Here, we combine the advantages of these two approaches in the form of a Markov state model of Markov state models, which we call a Hierarchical Markov state model. In this approach, independent Markov models are constructed in regions of configuration space that are locally well sampled but are separated by large free-energy barriers from other regions. A string method is used to construct an ensemble of pathways connecting the states of these different local Markov models, and the rate through each pathway is then estimated. These rates are then combined with the rate information from the local Markov models in a master equation to predict global rates, fluxes, and populations. By applying this hierarchical approach to tractable systems, a toy potential and dipeptides, we demonstrate that it is more accurate than the conventional single-pathway description. The advantages of this approach are that it (i) is more realistic than the conventional chain-of-states approach, as an ensemble of pathways rather than a single pathway is used to describe processes in high-dimensional systems, and (ii) it resolves the issue of poor sampling in Markov State model building when large free-energy barriers are present. The divide-and-conquer strategy inherent to this approach should make this procedure straightforward to apply to more complex systems.

Here, we investigate this process using a combination of multiscale modeling, ribosome profiling, and gene ontology analyses. Simulating the ejection of a representative set of 122 E. coli proteins we find a greater than 1000-fold variation in ejection times. Nascent proteins enriched in negatively charged residues near their C-terminus eject the fastest, while nascent chains enriched in positively charged residues tend to eject much more slowly. More work is required to pull slowly ejecting proteins out of the exit tunnel than quickly ejecting proteins, according to all-atom simulations. An energetic decomposition reveals, for slowly ejecting proteins, that this is due to the strong attractive electrostatic interactions between the nascent chain and the negatively charged ribosomal-RNA lining the exit tunnel, and for quickly ejecting proteins, it is due to their repulsive electrostatic interactions with the exit tunnel. Ribosome profiling data from E. coli reveals that the presence of slowly ejecting sequences correlates with ribosomes spending more time at stop codons, indicating that the ejection process might delay ribosome recycling. Proteins that have the highest positive charge density at their C-terminus are overwhelmingly ribosomal proteins, suggesting the possibility that this sequence feature may aid in the cotranslational assembly of ribosomes by delaying the release of nascent ribosomal proteins into the cytosol. Thus, nascent chain ejection times from the ribosome can vary greatly between proteins due to differential electrostatic interactions, can influence ribosome recycling, and could be particularly relevant to the synthesis and cotranslational behavior of some proteins.

Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV, which caused a global epidemic with 8096 confirmed cases in more than 25 countries from 2002 to 2003. Given the significant morbidity and mortality rate, the current pandemic poses a danger to all of humanity, prompting us to understand the activity of SARS-CoV-2 at the atomic level. Experimental studies have revealed that spike proteins of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) before entering the cell for replication. However, the binding affinities reported by different groups seem to contradict each other. Wrapp et al. (Science 2020, 367, 1260−1263) showed that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 peptidase domain (ACE2-PD) more strongly than does SARS-CoV, and this fact may be associated with a greater severity of the new virus. However, Walls et al. (Cell 2020, 181, 281−292) reported that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a higher binding affinity, but the difference between the two variants is relatively small. To understand the binding mechnism and experimental results, we investigated how the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-RBD) and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-RBD) interacts with a human ACE2-PD using molecular modeling. We applied a coarse-grained model to calculate the dissociation constant and found that SARS-CoV-2 displays a 2-fold higher binding affinity. Using steered all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, like a coarse-grained simulation, SARS-CoV-2-RBD was associated with ACE2-PD more strongly than was SARS-CoV-RBD, as evidenced by a higher rupture force and larger pulling work. We show that the binding affinity of both viruses to ACE2 is driven by electrostatic interactions. © 2020 American Chemical Society</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Leininger20194657" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Mechanochemistry in Translation</div> <div class="author"> Sarah E.

One mechanism entails the generation of force by the nascent protein. Cotranslational processes, such as nascent protein folding, the emergence of unfolded nascent chain segments from the ribosome’s exit tunnel, and insertion of the nascent chain into or translocation of the nascent chain through membranes, can generate forces that are transmitted back to the peptidyl transferase center and affect translation rates. In this Perspective, we examine the processes that generate these forces, the mechanisms of transmission along the ribosomal exit tunnel to the peptidyl transferase center, and the effects of force on the ribosome’s catalytic cycle. We also discuss the physical models that have been developed to predict and explain force generation for individual processes and speculate about other processes that may generate forces that have yet to be tested. © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ahmed2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Identifying A- and P-site locations on ribosome-protected mRNA fragments using Integer Programming</div> <div class="author"> Nabeel Ahmed, Pietro Sormanni, Prajwal Ciryam, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

Many analyses of Ribo-Seq data have utilized heuristic approaches applied to a narrow range of fragment sizes to identify the A-site. In this study, we use Integer Programming to identify the A-site by maximizing an objective function that reflects the fact that the ribosome’s A-site on ribosome-protected fragments must reside between the second and stop codons of an mRNA. This identifies the A-site location as a function of the fragment’s size and its 5′ end reading frame in Ribo-Seq data generated from S. cerevisiae and mouse embryonic stem cells. The correctness of the identified A-site locations is demonstrated by showing that this method, as compared to others, yields the largest ribosome density at established stalling sites. By providing greater accuracy and utilization of a wider range of fragment sizes, our approach increases the signal-to-noise ratio of underlying biological signals associated with translation elongation at the codon length scale. © 2019, The Author(s).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Leininger20195523" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Domain topology, stability, and translation speed determine mechanical force generation on the ribosome</div> <div class="author"> Sarah E.

Such changes in speed can affect the structure and function of the newly synthesized protein as well as cellular phenotype. The domain properties that govern force generation have yet to be identified and understood, and the influence of translation speed is unknown because all reported measurements have been carried out on arrested ribosomes. Here, using coarse-grained molecular simulations and statistical mechanical modeling of protein synthesis, we demonstrate that force generation is determined by a domain’s stability and topology, as well as translation speed. The statistical mechanical models we create predict how force profiles depend on these properties. These results indicate that force measurements on arrested ribosomes will not always accurately reflect what happens in a cell, especially for slow-folding domains, and suggest the possibility that certain domain properties may be enriched or depleted across the structural proteome of organisms through evolutionary selection pressures to modulate protein synthesis speed and posttranslational protein behavior. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Translation involves molecules and chemical reactions, hence bioinformatics methods consistent with the laws of chemistry and physics are more likely to produce accurate results. Here, we derive simple equations based on chemical kinetic principles to measure the translation-initiation rate, transcriptome-wide elongation rate, and individual codon translation rates from ribosome profiling experiments. Our methods reproduce the known rates from ribosome profiles generated from detailed simulations of translation. By applying our methods to data from S. cerevisiae and mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that the extracted rates reproduce expected correlations with various molecular properties, and we also find that mouse embryonic stem cells have a global translation speed of 5.2 AA/s, in agreement with previous reports that used other approaches. Our analysis further reveals that a codon can exhibit up to 26-fold variability in its translation rate depending upon its context within a transcript. This broad distribution means that the average translation rate of a codon is not representative of the rate at which most instances of that codon are translated, and it suggests that translational regulation might be used by cells to a greater degree than previously thought. © 2019 Sharma et al.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Nguyen2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Erythromycin leads to differential protein expression through differences in electrostatic and dispersion interactions with nascent proteins</div> <div class="author"> Hoang Linh Nguyen, Dang Lan Pham, Edward P.

It is unclear why, at the molecular level, some proteins can be synthesized while others cannot. Here, we use steered molecular dynamics simulations to examine how erythromycin inhibits synthesis of the peptide ErmCL but not the peptide H-NS. By pulling these peptides through the exit tunnel of the E.coli ribosome with and without erythromycin present, we find that erythromycin directly interacts with both nascent peptides, but the force required for ErmCL to bypass erythromycin is greater than that of H-NS. The largest forces arise three to six residues from their N-terminus as they start to bypass Erythromycin. Decomposing the interaction energies between erythromycin and the peptides at this point, we find that there are stronger electrostatic and dispersion interactions with the more C-terminal residues of ErmCL than with H-NS. These results suggest that erythromycin slows or stalls synthesis of ErmCL compared to H-NS due to stronger interactions with particular residue positions along the nascent protein. © 2018 The Author(s).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Samelson2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Kinetic and structural comparison of a protein’s cotranslational folding and refolding pathways</div> <div class="author"> Avi J.

In vivo, folding can begin cotranslationally and protein quality control at the ribosome is essential for cellular proteostasis. We directly characterize and compare the refolding and cotranslational folding trajectories of the protein HaloTag. We introduce new techniques for both measuring folding kinetics and detecting the conformations of partially folded intermediates during translation in real time. We find that, although translation does not affect the rate-limiting step of HaloTag folding, a key aggregation-prone intermediate observed during in vitro refolding experiments is no longer detectable. This rerouting of the folding pathway increases HaloTag’s folding efficiency and may serve as a general chaperone-independent mechanism of quality control by the ribosome. © 2018 The Authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Sharma201894" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Non-equilibrium coupling of protein structure and function to translation–elongation kinetics</div> <div class="author"> Ajeet K Sharma and Edward P O’Brien </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Current Opinion in Structural Biology</em>, 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> Cited by: 42 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2018.01.005" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Protein folding research has been dominated by the assumption that thermodynamics determines protein structure and function. And that when the folding process is compromised in vivo the proteostasis machinery — chaperones, deaggregases, the proteasome — work to restore proteins to their soluble, functional form or degrade them to maintain the cellular pool of proteins in a quasi-equilibrium state. During the past decade, however, more and more proteins have been identified for which altering only their speed of synthesis alters their structure and function, the efficiency of the down-stream processes they take part in, and cellular phenotype. Indeed, evidence has emerged that evolutionary selection pressures have encoded translation-rate information into mRNA molecules to coordinate diverse co-translational processes. Thus, non-equilibrium physics can play a fundamental role in influencing nascent protein behavior, mRNA sequence evolution, and disease.

The naturally occurring sources of these mechanical forces, the mechanism by which they are transmitted 10 nm to the ribosome’s catalytic core, and how they influence peptide bond formation rates are largely unknown. Here, we identify a new source of mechanical force acting on the ribosome by using in situ experimental measurements of changes in nascent-chain extension in the exit tunnel in conjunction with all-atom and coarse-grained computer simulations. We demonstrate that when the number of residues composing a nascent chain increases, its unstructured segments outside the ribosome exit tunnel generate piconewtons of force that are fully transmitted to the ribosome’s P-site. The route of force transmission is shown to be through the nascent polypetide’s backbone, not through the wall of the ribosome’s exit tunnel. Utilizing quantum mechanical calculations we find that a consequence of such a pulling force is to decrease the transition state free energy barrier to peptide bond formation, indicating that the elongation of a nascent chain can accelerate translation. Since nascent protein segments can start out as largely unfolded structural ensembles, these results suggest a pulling force is present during protein synthesis that can modulate translation speed. The mechanism of force transmission we have identified and its consequences for peptide bond formation should be relevant regardless of the source of the pulling force. © 2018 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Nissley20189927" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Structural Origins of FRET-Observed Nascent Chain Compaction on the Ribosome</div> <div class="author"> Daniel A.

An increase in fluorescence was observed to begin 10 s after translation was initiated, indicating the domain became more compact in size. Since fluorescence only reports a single value at each time point it contains very little information about the structural ensemble that gives rise to it. Here, we supplement this experimental information with coarse-grained simulations that describe protein conformations and transitions at a spatial resolution of 3.8 Å. We use these simulations to test three hypotheses that might explain the cause of domain compaction: (1) that poor solvent quality conditions drive the unfolded state to compact, (2) that a change in the dimension of the space the domain occupies upon moving outside the exit tunnel causes compaction, or (3) that domain folding causes compaction. We find that domain folding and dimensional collapse are both consistent with the experimental data, while poor-solvent collapse is inconsistent. We identify alternative dye labeling positions on HemK that upon fluorescence can differentiate between the domain folding and dimensional collapse mechanisms. Partial folding of domains has been observed in C-terminally truncated forms of proteins. Therefore, it is likely that the experimentally observed compact state is a partially folded intermediate consisting, according to our simulations, of the first three helices of the HemK N-terminal domain adopting a native, tertiary configuration. With these simulations we also identify the possible cotranslational folding pathways of HemK.

This wide range of elongation times, coupled with differences in codon usage between transcripts, suggests that the average codon translation-rate per gene can vary widely. Yet, ribosome run-off experiments have found that the average codon translation rate for different groups of transcripts in mouse stem cells is constant at 5.6 AA/s. How these seemingly contradictory results can be reconciled is the focus of this study. Here, we combine knowledge of the molecular factors shown to influence translation speed with genomic information from Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens to simulate the synthesis of cytosolic proteins in these organisms. The model recapitulates a near constant average translation rate, which we demonstrate arises because the molecular determinants of translation speed are distributed nearly randomly amongst most of the transcripts. Consequently, codon translation rates are also randomly distributed and fast-translating segments of a transcript are likely to be offset by equally probable slow-translating segments, resulting in similar average elongation rates for most transcripts. We also show that the codon usage bias does not significantly affect the near random distribution of codon translation rates because only about 10% of the total transcripts in an organism have high codon usage bias while the rest have little to no bias.

To reveal its working principle, we determined the nascent chain-binding pattern of Ssb at near-residue resolution by in vivo selective ribosome profiling. Ssb associates broadly with cytosolic, nuclear, and hitherto unknown substrate classes of mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) nascent proteins, supporting its general chaperone function. Ssb engages most substrates by multiple binding-release cycles to a degenerate sequence enriched in positively charged and aromatic amino acids. Timely association with this motif upon emergence at the ribosomal tunnel exit requires ribosome-associated complex (RAC) but not nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC). Ribosome footprint densities along orfs reveal faster translation at times of Ssb binding, mainly imposed by biases in mRNA secondary structure, codon usage, and Ssb action. Ssb thus employs substrate-tailored dynamic nascent chain associations to coordinate co-translational protein folding, facilitate accelerated translation, and support membrane targeting of organellar proteins. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Sharma20176775" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Increasing Protein Production Rates Can Decrease the Rate at Which Functional Protein is Produced and Their Steady-State Levels</div> <div class="author"> Ajeet K.

To understand this phenomenon, here, we combine a well-established ribosome-traffic model with a master-equation model of cotranslational domain folding to explore the scenarios that are possible for the protein production rate, J, and the functional-nascent protein production rate, F, as the rates of various translation processes are altered for five different E. coli proteins. We find that while J monotonically increases as the rates of translation-initiation, -elongation, and -termination increase, F can either increase or decrease. We show that F’s nonmonotonic behavior arises within the model from two opposing trends: the tendency for increased translation rates to produce more total protein but less cotranslationally folded protein. We further demonstrate that under certain conditions these nonmonotonic changes in F can result in nonmonotonic variations in post-translational, steady-state levels of functional protein. These results provide a potential explanation for recent experimental observations in which the specific activity of enzymatic proteins decreased with increased synthesis rates. Additionally our model has the potential to be used to rationally design transcripts to maximize the production of functional nascent protein by simultaneously optimizing translation initiation, elongation, and termination rates. © 2017 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Trovato20171807" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Fast Protein Translation Can Promote Co- and Posttranslational Folding of Misfolding-Prone Proteins</div> <div class="author"> Fabio Trovato and Edward P.

Consistent with this prediction, protein aggregation in yeast and worms was observed to increase when translation was globally slowed down, possibly due to increased cotranslational misfolding. Observation of similar behavior in molecular simulations would confirm predictions from the simpler chemical kinetic model and provide a molecular perspective on cotranslational folding, misfolding, and the impact of translation speed on these processes. All-atom simulations cannot reach the timescales relevant to protein synthesis, and most conventional structure-based coarse-grained models do not allow for nonnative structure formation. Here, we introduce a protocol to incorporate misfolding using the functional forms of publicly available force fields. With this model we create two artificial proteins that are capable of undergoing structural transitions between a native and a misfolded conformation and simulate their synthesis by the ribosome. Consistent with the chemical kinetic predictions, we find that rapid synthesis of misfolding-prone nascent-chain segments increases the fraction of folded proteins by kinetically partitioning more molecules through on-pathway intermediates, decreasing the likelihood of sampling misfolded conformations. Novel to this study, to our knowledge, we observe that differences in protein dynamics, arising from different translation-elongation schedules, can persist long after the nascent protein has been released from the ribosome, and that a sufficient level of energetic frustration is needed for fast-translating codons to be beneficial for folding. These results provide further evidence that fast-translating codons can be as biologically important as pause sites in coordinating cotranslational folding. © 2017 Biophysical Society</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Trovato2016345" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Insights into Cotranslational Nascent Protein Behavior from Computer Simulations</div> <div class="author"> Fabio Trovato and Edward P.

The development of therapeutic treatments for HD is hindered by the fact that while the etiology and symptoms of HD are understood, the molecular processes connecting this genotype to its phenotype remain unclear. Here, we propose the novel hypothesis that the perturbation of a co-translational process affects mutant huntingtin due to altered translation-elongation kinetics. These altered kinetics arise from the shift of a proline-induced translational pause site away from Htt’s localization sequence due to the expansion of the CAG-repeat segment between the poly-proline and localization sequences. Motivation for this hypothesis comes from recent experiments in the field of protein biogenesis that illustrate the critical role that temporal coordination of co-translational processes plays in determining the function, localization, and fate of proteins in cells. We show that our hypothesis is consistent with various experimental observations concerning HD pathology, including the dependence of the age of symptom onset on CAG repeat number. Finally, we suggest three experiments to test our hypothesis. © 2016 Nissley and O’Brien.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Sharma20161180" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Physical Origins of Codon Positions That Strongly Influence Cotranslational Folding: A Framework for Controlling Nascent-Protein Folding</div> <div class="author"> Ajeet K.

Synonymous codon substitutions, which change the translation rate at select codon positions along a transcript, have been shown to alter cotranslational protein folding, suggesting that evolution may have shaped synonymous codon usage in the genomes of organisms in part to increase the amount of folded and functional nascent protein. Here, we develop a Monte Carlo-master-equation method that allows for the control of nascent-chain folding during translation through the rational design of mRNA sequences to guide the cotranslational folding process. We test this framework using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and find it provides optimal mRNA sequences to control the simulated, cotranslational folding of a protein in a user-prescribed manner. With this approach we discover that some codon positions in a transcript can have a much greater impact on nascent-protein folding than others because they tend to be positions where the nascent chain populates states that are far from equilibrium, as well as being dependent on a complex ratio of time scales. As a consequence, different cotranslational profiles of the same protein can have different critical codon positions and different numbers of synonymous mRNA sequences that encode for them. These findings explain that there is a fundamental connection between the nonequilibrium nature of cotranslational processes, nascent-protein behavior, and synonymous codon usage. © 2015 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Caniparoli2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Modeling the effect of codon translation rates on co-translational protein folding mechanisms of arbitrary complexity</div> <div class="author"> Luca Caniparoli and Edward P.

The rate at which individual amino acids are incorporated into the elongating nascent chain has been shown to affect the likelihood that proteins will populate their folded state, indicating that co-translational protein folding is a far from equilibrium process. Developing a theoretical framework to accurately describe this process is, therefore, crucial for advancing our understanding of how proteins acquire their functional conformation in living cells. Current state-of-the-art computational approaches, such as molecular dynamics simulations, are very demanding in terms of the required computer resources, making the simulation of co-translational protein folding difficult. Here, we overcome this limitation by introducing an efficient approach that predicts the effects that variable codon translation rates have on co-translational folding pathways. Our approach is based on Markov chains. By using as an input a relatively small number of molecular dynamics simulations, it allows for the computation of the probability that a nascent protein is in any state as a function of the translation rate of individual codons along a mRNA’s open reading frame. Due to its computational efficiency and favorable scalability with the complexity of the folding mechanism, this approach could enable proteome-wide computational studies of the influence of translation dynamics on co-translational folding. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Nilsson20151533" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Cotranslational Protein Folding inside the Ribosome Exit Tunnel</div> <div class="author"> Ola B.

It is well established that proteins can fold cotranslationally outside the ribosome exit tunnel, whereas studies of folding inside the exit tunnel have so far detected only the formation of helical secondary structure and collapsed or partially structured folding intermediates. Here, using a combination of cotranslational nascent chain force measurements, inter-subunit fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies on single translating ribosomes, molecular dynamics simulations, and cryoelectron microscopy, we show that a small zinc-finger domain protein can fold deep inside the vestibule of the ribosome exit tunnel. Thus, for small protein domains, the ribosome itself can provide the kind of sheltered folding environment that chaperones provide for larger proteins. Nilsson et al. present an integrated approach to the study of cotranslational protein folding, in which the folding transition is mapped by arrest-peptide-mediated force measurements, molecular dynamics simulations, and cryo-EM (electron microscopy). The small zinc-finger domain ADR1a is shown to fold deep inside the ribosome exit tunnel. © 2015 The Authors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2014</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Nissley201417892" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Timing is everything: Unifying Codon translation rates and nascent proteome behavior</div> <div class="author"> Daniel A.

If a protein does not fold cotranslationally, however, it has the opportunity to do so post-translationally, that is, after the nascent chain has been fully synthesized and released from the ribosome. The rate at which a ribosome adds an amino acid encoded by a particular codon to the elongating nascent chain can vary significantly and is called the codon translation rate. Recent experiments have illustrated the profound impact that codon translation rates can have on the cotranslational folding process and the acquisition of function by nascent proteins. Synonymous codon mutations in an mRNA molecule change the chemical identity of a codon and its translation rate without changing the sequence of the synthesized protein. This change in codon translation rate can, however, cause a nascent protein to malfunction as a result of cotranslational misfolding. In some situations, such dysfunction can have profound implications; for example, it can alter the substrate specificity of an ABC transporter protein, resulting in patients who are nonresponsive to chemotherapy treatment. Thus, codon translation rates are crucial in coordinating protein folding in a cellular environment and can affect downstream cellular processes that depend on the proper functioning of newly synthesized proteins. As the importance of codon translation rates makes clear, a necessary aspect of fully understanding cotranslational folding lies in considering the kinetics of the process in addition to its thermodynamics.In this Account, we examine the contributions that have been made to elucidating the mechanisms of cotranslational folding by using the theoretical and computational tools of chemical kinetics, molecular simulations, and systems biology. These efforts have extended our ability to understand, model, and predict the influence of codon translation rates on cotranslational protein folding and misfolding. The application of such approaches to this important problem is creating a framework for making quantitative predictions of the impact of synonymous codon substitutions on cotranslational folding that has led to a novel hypothesis regarding the role of fast-translating codons in coordinating cotranslational folding. In addition, it is providing new insights into proteome-wide cotranslational folding behavior and making it possible to identify potential molecular mechanisms by which molecular chaperones can influence such behavior during protein synthesis. As we discuss in this Account, bringing together these theoretical developments with experimental approaches is increasingly helping answer fundamental questions about the nature of nascent protein folding on the ribosome. © 2014 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="O'brien2014" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Kinetic modelling indicates that fast-translating codons can coordinate cotranslational protein folding by avoiding misfolded intermediates</div> <div class="author"> Edward P.

Here we investigate whether or not this inverse relationship between translation speed and the cotranslational folding probability is a general phenomenon or if other scenarios are possible. We first derive chemical kinetic equations that relate individual codon translation rates to the probability that a domain will fold, populate an intermediate or misfold, and examine the cotranslational folding scenarios that are possible within these models. We find that speeding up codon translation through misfolding-prone segments can, in some cases, increase the folding probability of a domain immediately before the nascent protein is released from the ribosome and decrease its chances of misfolding. Thus, for some proteins fast-translating codons could be as important as slow-translating codons in coordinating cotranslational protein folding.© 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This is because translation rates can reduce the probability of cotranslational folding below that associated with arrested ribosomes, whose behavior is determined by the equilibrium thermodynamics of the RNC complex. Here, we combine a chemical kinetic equation with genomic and proteomic data to predict domain folding probabilities as a function of nascent chain length for Escherichia coli cytosolic proteins synthesized on both arrested and continuously translating ribosomes. Our results indicate that, at in vivo translation rates, about one-third of the Escherichia coli cytosolic proteins exhibit cotranslational folding, with at least one domain in each of these proteins folding into its stable native structure before the full-length protein is released from the ribosome. The majority of these cotranslational folding domains are influenced by translation kinetics which reduces their probability of cotranslational folding and consequently increases the nascent chain length at which they fold into their native structures. For about 20% of all cytosolic proteins this delay in folding can exceed the length of the completely synthesized protein, causing one or more of their domains to switch from co-to posttranslational folding solely as a result of the in vivo translation rates. These kinetic effects arise from the difference in time scales of folding and amino-acid addition, and they represent a source of metastability in Escherichia coli ’s proteome.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="O'Brien2013" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Erratum: Prediction of variable translation rate effects on cotranslational protein folding (Nature Communications (2012) 3 (868) DOI: 10.1038/ncomms1850)</div> <div class="author"> Edward P.

The molecular transfer model (MTM), which incorporates environmental changes using measured quantities in molecular simulations, overcomes these difficulties. Predictions of the folding thermodynamics and kinetics of a number of proteins using MTM simulations are in remarkable agreement with experiments.

Small protein domains can fold under the cradle created by TF, but the co-translational folding of larger proteins is slowed down by its presence. Because of the great experimental challenges in achieving high spatial and time resolution, it is not yet known whether or not TF alters the folding properties of small proteins and if the reduced rate of folding of larger proteins is the result of kinetic or thermodynamic effects. We show, by molecular simulations employing a coarse-grained model of a series of ribosome nascent-chain complexes, that TF does not alter significantly the co-translational folding process of a small protein G domain but delays that of a large β-galactosidase domain as a result of kinetic trapping of its unfolded ensemble. We demonstrate that this trapping occurs through a combination of three distinct mechanisms: a decrease in the rate of structural rearrangements within the nascent chain, an increase in the effective exit tunnel length due to folding outside the cradle, and entanglement of the nascent chain with TF. We present evidence that this TF-induced trapping represents a trade-off between promoting co-translational folding and sterically shielding the nascent chain from aberrant cytosolic interactions that could lead to its aggregation or degradation. © 2012 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="O'Brien2012979" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effects of pH on proteins: Predictions for ensemble and single-molecule pulling experiments</div> <div class="author"> Edward P.

A quantitative description of the changes in the relative stabilities of the various thermodynamic states is needed to interpret and predict experimental outcomes. We provide a framework based on the Molecular Transfer Model (MTM) to account for pH effects on the properties of globular proteins. The MTM utilizes the partition function of a protein calculated from molecular simulations at one set of solution conditions to predict protein properties at another set of solution conditions. To take pH effects into account, we utilized experimentally measured pK a values in the native and unfolded states to calculate the free energy of transferring a protein from a reference pH to the pH of interest. We validate our approach by demonstrating that the native-state stability as a function of pH is accurately predicted for chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) and protein G. We use the MTM to predict the response of CI2 and protein G subjected to a constant force (f) and varying pH. The phase diagrams of CI2 and protein G as a function of f and pH are dramatically different and reflect the underlying pH-dependent stability changes in the absence of force. The calculated equilibrium free energy profiles as functions of the end-to-end distance of the two proteins show that, at various pH values, CI2 unfolds via an intermediate when subjected to f. The locations of the two transition states move toward the more unstable state as f is changed, which is in accord with the Hammond-Leffler postulate. In sharp contrast, force-induced unfolding of protein G occurs in a single step. Remarkably, the location of the transition state with respect to the folded state is independent of f, which suggests that protein G is mechanically brittle. The MTM provides a natural framework for predicting the outcomes of ensemble and single-molecule experiments for a wide range of solution conditions. © 2011 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="O'Brien2012" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Prediction of variable translation rate effects on cotranslational protein folding</div> <div class="author"> Edward P.

Experiments often use urea and guanidinium chloride to study folding whereas the natural variable in simulations is temperature. To bridge the gap, we use the molecular transfer model that combines measured denaturant-dependent transfer free energies for the peptide group and amino acid residues, and a coarse-grained Cα-side chain model for polypeptide chains to simulate the folding of src SH3 domain. Stability of the native state decreases linearly as [C] (the concentration of guanidinium chloride) increases with the slope, m, that is in excellent agreement with experiments. Remarkably, the calculated folding rate at [C]=0 is only 16-fold larger than the measured value. Most importantly ln kobs (kobs is the sum of folding and unfolding rates) as a function of [C] has the characteristic V (chevron) shape. In every folding trajectory, the times for reaching the native state, interactions stabilizing all the substructures, and global collapse coincide. The value of m f/m (mf is the slope of the folding arm of the chevron plot) is identical to the fraction of buried solvent accessible surface area in the structures of the transition state ensemble. In the dominant transition state, which does not vary significantly at low [C], the core of the protein and certain loops are structured. Besides solving the long-standing problem of computing the chevron plot, our work lays the foundation for incorporating denaturant effects in a physically transparent manner either in all-atom or coarse-grained simulations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Obrien20111171" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Influence of nanoparticle size and shape on oligomer formation of an amyloidogenic peptide</div> <div class="author"> Edward P.

Using all-atom molecular simulations in implicit solvent, we illustrate the effects of nanoparticle size, shape, and volume fraction on oligomer formation of an amyloidogenic peptide from the transthyretin protein. Surprisingly, we find that inert spherical crowding particles destabilize in-register β-sheets formed by dimers while stabilizing β-sheets comprised of trimers and tetramers. As the radius of the nanoparticle increases, crowding effects decrease, implying that smaller crowding particles have the largest influence on the earliest amyloid species. We explain these results using a theory based on the depletion effect. Finally, we show that spherocylindrical crowders destabilize the ordered β-sheet dimer to a greater extent than spherical crowders, which underscores the influence of nanoparticle shape on protein aggregation. © 2011 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="O'Brien2011513" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">New scenarios of protein folding can occur on the ribosome</div> <div class="author"> Edward P.

Using Langevin dynamics, we have simulated intact ribosomes containing five different nascent chains arrested at different stages of their synthesis such that each nascent chain can fold and unfold at or near the exit tunnel vestibule. We find that the native state is destabilized close to the ribosome surface due to an increase in unfolded state entropy and a decrease in native state entropy; the former arises because the unfolded ensemble tends to behave as an expanded random coil near the ribosome and a semicompact globule in bulk solution. In addition, the unfolded ensemble of the nascent chain adopts a highly anisotropic shape near the ribosome surface and the cooperativity of the folding-unfolding transition is decreased due to the appearance of partially folded structures that are not populated in bulk solution. The results show, in light of these effects, that with increasing nascent chain length folding rates increase in a linear manner and unfolding rates decrease, with larger and topologically more complex folds being the most highly perturbed by the ribosome. Analysis of folding trajectories, initiated by temperature quench, reveals the transition state ensemble is driven toward compaction and greater native-like structure by interactions with the ribosome surface and exit vestibule. Furthermore, the diversity of folding pathways decreases and the probability increases of initiating folding via the N-terminus on the ribosome. We show that all of these findings are equally applicable to the situation in which protein folding occurs during continuous (non-arrested) translation provided that the time scales of folding and unfolding are much faster than the time scale of monomer addition to the growing nascent chain, which results in a quasi-equilibrium process. These substantial ribosome-induced perturbations to almost all aspects of protein folding indicate that folding scenarios that are distinct from those of bulk solution can occur on the ribosome. © 2011 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2010</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Thirumalai2010159" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Theoretical perspectives on protein folding</div> <div class="author"> D.

Significant advances in theory and experiments have resulted in a conceptual framework for describing the folding mechanisms of globular proteins. The sizes of proteins in the denatured and folded states, cooperativity of the folding transition, dispersions in the melting temperatures at the residue level, and timescales of folding are, to a large extent, determined by N, the number of residues. The intricate details of folding as a function of denaturant concentration can be predicted by using a novel coarse-grained molecular transfer model. By watching one molecule fold at a time, using single-molecule methods, investigators have established the validity of the theoretically anticipated heterogeneity in the folding routes and the N-dependent timescales for the three stages in the approach to the native state. Despite the successes of theory, of which only a few examples are documented here, we conclude that much remains to be done to solve the protein folding problem in the broadest sense.

Here we show, on the basis of molecular simulations and comparison with experiment, that the long-range contacts essential for initiating protein folding can form within a nascent chain when it reaches the last 20 Å of the exit tunnel. We further show that, in this "exit port", a significant proportion of native and non-native tertiary structure can form without steric overlap with the ribosome itself, and provide a library of structural elements that our simulations predict can form in the exit tunnel and is amenable to experimental testing. Our results show that these elements of folded tertiary structure form only transiently and are at their midpoints of stability at the boundary region between the inside and the outside of the tunnel. These findings provide a framework for interpreting a range of recent experimental studies of ribosome nascent chain complexes and for understanding key aspects of the nature of co-translational folding. © 2010 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2009</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="O'Brien200914421" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Thermodynamic perspective on the dock-lock growth mechanism of amyloid fibrils</div> <div class="author"> Edward P.

On the basis of the kinetics of monomer disassociation of Aβ(1-40) from the amyloid fibril, it has been suggested that deposition is a multistep process involving a rapid reversible association of the unstructured monomer to the fibril surface (docking) followed by a slower conformational rearrangement leading to the incorporation onto the underlying fibril lattice (locking). By exploiting the vast time scale separation between the dock and lock processes and using molecular dynamics simulation of deposition of the disordered peptide fragment 35MVGGVV40 from the Aβ peptide onto the fibril with known crystal structure, we provide a thermodynamic basis for the dock-lock mechanism of fibril growth. Free energy profiles, computed using implicit solvent model and enhanced sampling methods with the distance (δc) between the center of mass of the peptide and the fibril surface as the order parameter, show three distinct basins of attraction. When δc is large, the monomer is compact and unstructured and the favorable interactions with the fibril results in stretching of the peptide at δc = 13 Å. As δc is further decreased, the peptide docks onto the fibril surface with a structure that is determined by a balance between intrapeptide and peptide fibril interactions. At δc = 4 Å, a value that is commensurate with the spacing between /3-strands in the fibril, the monomer expands and locks onto the fibril. Using simulations with implicit solvent model and all atom molecular dynamics in explicit water, we show that the locked monomer, which interacts with the underlying fibril, undergoes substantial conformational fluctuations and is not stable. The cosolutes urea and TMAO destabilize the unbound phase and stabilize the docked phase. Interestingly, small crowding particles enhance the stability of the fibril-bound monomer only marginally. We predict that the experimentally measurable critical monomer concentration, CR, at which the soluble unbound monomer is in equilibrium with the ordered fibril, increases sharply as temperature is increased under all solution conditions. © 2009 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="O'Brien20093743" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Molecular origin of constant m-values, denatured state collapse, and residue-dependent transition midpoints in globular proteins</div> <div class="author"> Edward P.

The slope m = [dΔGND([C])]/ (d[C]), is nearly constant. According to the transfer model, the m-value is associated with the difference in the surface area between the native (N) and denatured (D) state, which should be a function of ΔRg 2, the difference in the square of the radius of gyration between the D and N states. Single-molecule experiments show that the Rg of the structurally heterogeneous denatured state undergoes an equilibrium collapse transition as [C] decreases, which implies m also should be [C]-dependent. We resolve the conundrum between constant m-values and [C]-dependent changes in Rg using molecular simulations of a coarse-grained representation of protein L, and the molecular transfer model, for which the equilibrium folding can be accurately calculated as a function of denaturant (urea) concentration. In agreement with experiment, we find that over a large range of denaturant concentration (&gt;3 M) the m-value is a constant, whereas under strongly renaturing conditions (&lt;3 M), it depends on [C]. The m-value is a constant above [C] &gt; 3 M because the [C]-dependent changes in the surface area of the backbone groups, which make the largest contribution to m, are relatively narrow in the denatured state. The burial of the backbone and hydrophobic side chains gives rise to substantial surface area changes below [C] &lt; 3 M, leading to collapse in the denatured state of protein L. Dissection of the contribution of various amino acids to the total surface area change with [C] shows that both the sequence context and residual structure are important. There are [C]-dependent variations in the surface area for chemically identical groups such as the backbone or Ala. Consequently, the midpoints of transition of individual residues vary significantly (which we call the Holtzer effect) even though global folding can be described as an all-or-none transition. The collapse is specific in nature, resulting in the formation of compact structures with appreciable populations of nativelike secondary structural elements. The collapse transition is driven by the loss of favorable residue-solvent interactions and a concomitant increase in the strength of intrapeptide interactions with a decreasing [C]. The strength of these interactions is nonuniformly distributed throughout the structure of protein L. Certain secondary structure elements have stronger [C]-dependent interactions than others in the denatured state. © 2009 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="O'Brien2009" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">How accurate are polymer models in the analysis of Förster resonance energy transfer experiments on proteins?</div> <div class="author"> Edward P.

From the measured average FRET efficiency, 〈E〉, the distance distribution P (R) is inferred by assuming that the DSE can be described as a polymer. The single parameter in the appropriate polymer model (Gaussian chain, wormlike chain, or self-avoiding walk) for P (R) is determined by equating the calculated and measured 〈E〉. In order to assess the accuracy of this "standard procedure," we consider the generalized Rouse model (GRM), whose properties [〈E〉 and P (R)] can be analytically computed, and the Molecular Transfer Model for protein L for which accurate simulations can be carried out as a function of guanadinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) concentration. Using the precisely computed 〈E〉 for the GRM and protein L, we infer P (R) using the standard procedure. We find that the mean end-to-end distance can be accurately inferred (less than 10% relative error) using 〈E〉 and polymer models for P (R). However, the value extracted for the radius of gyration (Rg) and the persistence length (lp) are less accurate. For protein L, the errors in the inferred properties increase as the GdmCl concentration increases for all polymer models. The relative error in the inferred Rg and lp, with respect to the exact values, can be as large as 25% at the highest GdmCl concentration. We propose a self-consistency test, requiring measurements of 〈E〉 by attaching dyes to different residues in the protein, to assess the validity of describing DSE using the Gaussian model. Application of the self-consistency test to the GRM shows that even for this simple model, which exhibits an order→disorder transition, the Gaussian P (R) is inadequate. Analysis of experimental data of FRET efficiencies with dyes at several locations for the cold shock protein, and simulations results for protein L, for which accurate FRET efficiencies between various locations were computed, shows that at high GdmCl concentrations there are significant deviations in the DSE P (R) from the Gaussian model. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2008</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="O'Brien20083702" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Factors governing helix formation in peptides confined to carbon nanotubes</div> <div class="author"> Edward P.

We have examined the stability of different helix-forming sequences upon confinement to a carbon nanotube using Langevin dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained representation of the polypeptide chain. We show that the interplay of several factors that include sequence, solvent conditions, strength (λ) of nanotube-peptide interactions, and the nanotube diameter (D) determines confinement-induced stability of helicies. In agreement with predictions based on polymer theory, the helical state is entropically stabilized for all sequences when the interaction between the peptide and the nanotube is weakly hydrophobic and D is small. However, there is a strong sequence dependence as the strength of the λ increases. For an amphiphilic sequence, the helical stability increases with λ, whereas for polyalanine the diagram of states is a complex function of λ and D. In addition, decreasing the size of the "hydrophobic patch" lining the nanotube, which mimics the chemical heterogeneity of the ribosome tunnel, increases the helical stability of the polyalanine sequence. Our results provide a framework for interpreting a number of experiments involving the structure formation of peptides in the ribosome tunnel as well as transport of biopolymers through nanotubes. © 2008 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="O'Brien200813403" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effects of denaturants and osmolytes on proteins are accurately predicted by the molecular transfer model</div> <div class="author"> Edward P.

Osmolytes, a class of small intracellular organic molecules found in all taxa, also profoundly affect the equilibrium properties of proteins. We introduce the molecular transfer model, which combines simulations in the absence of denaturants or osmolytes, and Tanford’s transfer model to predict the dependence of equilibrium properties of proteins at finite concentration of osmolytes. The calculated changes in the thermodynamic quantities (probability of being in the native basin of attraction,m values, FRET efficiency, and structures of the denatured state ensemble) with GdmCl concentration [C] for the protein L and cold shock protein CspTm compare well with experiments. The radii of gyration of the subpopulation of unfolded molecules for both proteins decrease (i.e., they undergo a collapse transition) as [C] decreases. Although global folding is cooperative, residual secondary structures persist at high denaturant concentrations. The temperature dependence of the specific heat shows that the folding temperature (TF) changes linearly as urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) concentrations increase. The increase in TF in TMAO can be as large as 20°C, whereas urea decreases TF by as much as 35°C. The stabilities of protein L and CspTm also increase linearly with the concentration of osmolytes (proline, sorbitol, sucrose, TMAO, and sarcosine). © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2007</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="O'Brien20077346" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Interactions between hydrophobic and ionic solutes in aqueous guanidinium chloride and urea solutions: Lessons for protein denaturation mechanism</div> <div class="author"> Edward P.

Hydrophobic association is not significantly changed in urea or guanidinium chloride solutions. The strength of interaction between ion pairs is greatly diminished by the guanidinium ion. Although the changes in electrostatic interactions in urea are small, examination of structures, using appropriate pair functions, of urea and water around the solutes show strong hydrogen bonding between urea’s carbonyl oxygen and the positively charged solute. Our results strongly suggest protein denaturation occurs by the direct interaction model according to which the most commonly used denaturants unfold proteins by altering electrostatic interactions either by solvating the charged residues or by engaging in hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone. To further validate the direct interaction model we show that, in urea and guanidinium chloride solutions, unfolding of an unusually stable helix (H1) from mouse PrPC (residues 144-153) occurs by hydrogen bonding of denaturants to charged side chains and backbone carbonyl groups. © 2007 American Chemical Society.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2006</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Kouza2006671" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effect of finite size on cooperativity and rates of protein folding</div> <div class="author"> Maksim Kouza, Mai Suan Li, Edward P.

A dimensionless measure of cooperativity, Ω c (0 &lt; Ω c &lt; ∞), scales as Ω c ≈ Nζ. The results of simulations and the analysis of experimental data further confirm the earlier prediction that ζ is universal with ζ = 1 + γ, where exponent γ characterizes the susceptibility of a self-avoiding walk. This finding suggests that the structural characteristics in the denaturated state are manifested in the folding cooperativity at the transition temperature. The folding rates k F for the Go models and a dataset of 69 proteins can be fit using k F = k F 0 exp(-cN β). Both β= 1/2 and 2/3 provide a good fit of the data. We find that k F = k F 0 exp(-cN 1/2), with the average (over the dataset of proteins) k F 0 ≈ (0.2 μs) -1 and c ≈ B 1.1, can be used to estimate folding rates to within an order of magnitude in most cases.

In one, the computed solid-state anomeric carbon chemical shifts for each cyclodextrin D-Glcp monomer were simply averaged to obtain an estimate of the 13C shifts in solution. In the other, chemical shifts for the anomeric carbons were determined by averaging back-calculated 13C shift trajectories derived from a series of 5ns molecular dynamic simulations for the oligosaccharides with explicit representation of water. Good agreement between calculated and experimental 13C shifts was found in all cases.

The systematic degradation of oligonucleotide strands during sample preparation is investigated by repeatedly freezing/thawing short strands followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometric (MALDI-MS) analysis. It is shown here that the longevity of an oligonucleotide strand is dependent on several factors including base composition, solution concentrations, and strand length as well as thawing conditions. Several trends in strand robustness were established. Our studies reveal that the robustness of strands is base-dependent: T-mer &gt; A-mer &gt; C-mer &gt; G-mer. Likewise, an increase in the length of the strands increases the tendency of a sample to degrade. Another observation included that samples of mixed bases degrade according to structural conformations. All of these obserrations are attributed to the fact that the samples undergo degradation during sample/solvent isolation during frezing.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 The O'Brien Lab .
